<h1>Crimson Romance <br /> <span class="subtitle">Ebook series with script based workflow</span> </h1>
<p>This is a project page</p>
<main><p>Crimson Romance is the romance line at Adams Media. This is an ebook-first series. For this series, I helped with a transition to a CMS-based workflow. </p>

<p>Due to the quick turnaround with this series, I was presented with an interesting challenge. The CMS filled in the metadata fields for the EPUB export; however, since the content was outpacing the metadata for this fast-paced workflow, I had to enter in that information manually: the cover, author name, title, and ISBN. Initially, I set up a set of regexes that I would run upon opening the files, but eventually I created a Python script. The script is available <a href="https://github.com/francofaa/RomanceEPUBCleanup">here on github</a>.</p>
