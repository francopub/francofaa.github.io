<h1>Strangelet Website 
<h2>Print book and ebooks for the literary magazine Strangelet, created 2015</h2>
<main><p><em>Strangelet</em> was a bimonthly literary magazine of fantasy, science fiction, and magical realism. In addition to creating and co-managing the website, I was also one of its co-founders and managed the <a href="../StrangeletPress">production of the books and ebooks</a>. The website is <a href="weblink">strangeletjournal.com</a>. The content manager and I also handled the updates to the site.</p>

<p>The website was built in Wordpress, using a child theme based on the theme Responsive.</p>

<p><img src="splash" alt="Home page" />
<em>Home page with call to action to view the current issue of the magazine</em></p>

<p><img src="mobile" alt="Mobile version" />
<em>The site is responsive. Resizing (and viewing on a phone) will adjust the look of the site.</em></p>

<p>The following three images show story excerpts on the website. The excerpts are pulled directly from the ebook edition of the website. The CSS for the ebook is different for the website.</p>

<p><img src="sidebars" alt="Full width screen version" />
<em>Excerpt of story on a full width screen</em></p>

<p><img src="narrow" alt="Resizing screen" />
<em>Making the screen smaller allows the sidebar elements to fall away to the bottom of the browser screen</em></p>

<p><img src="nodistract" alt="Distraction-free version" />
<em>This was a test version for a distraction-free version of an excerpt. This is found at <a href="samplelink">sample.strangeletjournal.com</a>.</em></p>
