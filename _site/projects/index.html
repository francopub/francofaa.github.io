			Strangelet was a bimonthly literary magazine of fantasy, science fiction, and magical realism. In addition to managing the design and production, I was also a co-founder, the website designer, and art editor. For Strangelet, I typeset the book in Caslon with the display text as Marta. The title page typeface is Hightower and the cover a combination of typefaces to reflect the tone of the books: strange, bizarre, eerie. We produced bimonthly issues, very short, around 50 to 70 pages each, and combined them in an omnibus at the end of the year. For the ebook edition, I was able...

Previously they had been using non-semantic tables, which presented various problems in resizing and accessibility. Due to compensate for e-reading technology, instead of using for a purely CSS3 solution, I included the numbering in the mark-up and used CSS to position the paragraphs appropriately.

		<div class="entry">
			Crimson Romance is the romance line at Adams Media. This is an ebook-first series. For this series, I helped with a transition to a CMS-based workflow. Due to the quick turnaround with this series, I was presented with an interesting challenge. The CMS filled in the metadata fields for the EPUB export; however, since the content was outpacing the metadata for this fast-paced workflow, I had to enter in that information manually: the cover, author name, title, and ISBN. Initially, I set up a set of regexes that I would run upon opening the files, but eventually I created a...
