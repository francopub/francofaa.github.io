<main><p>Litweaver was a library of original young adult literature developed for schools and distributed as EPUB and Mobi/KF8 files.</p>

<p>I worked with Litweaver for two years, creating over 100 ebooks for the series, which included short stories, novels, poems, and plays. I also developed a paragraph-numbering system for them. Previously they had been using non-semantic tables, which presented various problems in resizing and accessibility. Due to compensate for e-reading technology, instead of using for a purely CSS3 solution, I included the numbering in the mark-up and used CSS to position the paragraphs appropriately.</p>
