This is the repo for my personal website. As you can see, this site is built using Jekyll. This was my first Jekyll site and I quite enjoyed building it. Learned a lot in the process. 

I created two blogrolls for it, a projects blogroll for my portfolio section and a personal blogroll, which has not been filled in, so it is not visible (except here on the repo). I have recently added a new entry in the portfolio section after finalizing the site and it was pretty easy to do, so that is good.

The site that is deployed lives in the \_site folder.
