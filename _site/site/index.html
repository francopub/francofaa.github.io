<h1 id="aboutme">About Me</h1>
<p>
	I like to fix things: sentences, pages, and books. I like to make your content look good, whether it is a website, an ebook, or a print book--or all three! I have made publishing my career, both digital and print, and I want to help you.
</p>
<p>
	I&#8217;ve worn a lot of different hats. Currently my hat is Senior Technical Production Specialist at F+W Media where I focus on building templates, working on ebook quality assurance, and managing CMS publishing workflows for HTML, XML, ebook, and, of course, print.

<!--

<p>I like to fix things. Sentences, pages, books. I have been working in publishing since joining *Tea*, the literary magazine at the University of Florida in 2007. Since then, I&#8217;ve made publishing my career, dabbling in editorial departments, production departments, and even a literary agency before focusing on ebooks. I currently reside in the Boston area.</p>

<p>In 2014, I started **<a href="http://strangeletjournal.com">Strangelet Press </a>** with my colleagues, fellow graduates from Emerson College in Boston. We are a new science fiction and fantasy journal both in print and ebook formats. I design the print version of the book while simultaneously setting the files up for the ebook editions. I also built and designed the <a href="http://strangeletjournal.com">website</a> for the journal. Additionally, I also curate cover art and supervise the production process. Since it is a small operation of four core people, we all tend to wear different hats as we go on.
</p>
<p>In 2013, I started my freelance work in earnest. In addition to ebook development of all kinds, I also provide book layout design, editorial services, and workflow consultation to bring it all together for your project.
</p>
<p>In addition to designing for print, I also manage web-based projects. I built this website plus the website for Strangelet Press.
</p>
<p>Aside from my day job, my freelance work, and my work at Strangelet Press, I am also designing a board game and working on my own writing.
</p>
<p>Reach out to me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/NoFrancosPlease">@NoFrancosPlease </a>or by email via the big friendly contact button above. I am also on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/franco-alvarado/24/591/179">LinkedIn</a>. I always like to talk about writing and publishing.
