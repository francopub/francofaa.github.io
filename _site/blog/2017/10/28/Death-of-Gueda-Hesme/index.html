		<p>Tia Gueda Hesme lived in the house, having worked for the Von Kromer family for as long as anyone could remember. No one knew how she was related to the family, and Calébres and Alessandro doubted she was ever young. Her eyes were white and murky, and she looked as old as a tree, gnarled and knotted with wrinkles. She never moved as she sat in her chair, aside from moving her hand to her mouth to take a puff from her cigar.</p>

<p>—-Right down there, in the plaza, she told the boys in her strange accent, there used to be a well, and one of the boys—his name was Raul, one of the sons of Marcos. Marcos, now, he should be your great-great-great uncle. But yes, his boy would go to that well every day to get water, early in the morning, and one day, a voice called from inside the well, crying out to him, Up there, if you help me, I’ll give you all the money you could ever hope for. Just look, the voice said, and Raul saw something flash, like silver catching the sun. So Raul lowered the bucket and said, Get in the bucket, but the voice said back: No, you have to come down yourself and get me. So your cousin went down into the well, with the rope tied around his waist, and they never saw him again, no. Whatever was down there, snatched him away, and as she said this, her hand snatched something invisible out of the air. Alessandro flinched.</p>

<p>She would tell the boys a story every day, about heroes and princesses, about wars and adventures, all of them stories she had heard throughout her life in Egypt and Europe and India and South America and the Caribbean.</p>

<p>–This is a story my grandmother told me. It takes place a very long time ago, when this town was still jungle and when God still spoke to the best of us directly, when this was a wicked city where people only cared about themselves and they would eat each other. There was one good man that lived there, named Lucio, and two angels came to visit him to tell him to leave because God was going to destroy the city with fire from the sky. The angels told him to leave and not look back—-it was God’s command. So Lucio packed everything up and took his daughters and his wife away. They climbed the mountains, and as they crossed the bridge that took them out of sight of the city, Lucio’s wife paused in the middle and turned around and looked back and sighed. And for that, she was turned into a pillar of salt.</p>

<p>—But why? Alessandro asked.</p>

<p>She leaned forward toward the shape of the boy and strained her voice:</p>

<p>—Because she disobeyed God. There is something beautiful about disobeying, boys. To turn and sigh. It is so human, and I always loved her for that. I never even knew her name, and I have forgotten the rest of the story. Perhaps Lucio and his daughters were more favorable in the eyes of God, but in my cloudy eyes, it is she I love and remember, as a fellow soul, who has never disobeyed herself.</p>

<p>She leaned back in her chair and sat in silence for several minutes, cuing to the boys that they should leave. She began ending stories like that more often in the months before her death.</p>

<p>—The dead could come back, she told them one afternoon. Strong as oxen, with the same brains as well. In the Caribbean, strange things like that happen. They eat chickens alive and chant and go into frenzies, and those men who come out of the ground would work in the fields like slaves. Landowners would just steal people out of the ground. But that’s a foul thing to do to a man, boys, to use his body like that. It is disrespectful. Promise me you’ll never do such a thing, boys. Yes?</p>

<p>—Yes, Tia Hesme, they replied, but the comment seemed so strange to them, so frightening, they didn’t know what to think of it, so they would leave the room whenever she would say things like that, making up some excuse and occupying their minds on something else—for, had it been someone else, one of their school friends or family members, and not this ancient woman, heavy with sincerity and simplicity, it might have not been so frightening. There was too much truth in the spaces between her words. </p>

<p>And as she neared her death, in the last weeks, those moments happened more often, where she would ramble and say something so disturbing that the boys had to leave.</p>

<p>—A cigar, please, Alessandro, she said to the shape sitting in front of her, and the shape came closer to her and handed her one. A low flick sound, followed by the orange that burned on the end of the cigar. </p>

<p>—When you get to be my age, she told them, things become whole again, combining in colors and shapes. I believe it is like this when you are an infant, and you are first born and you flail around and weep uncontrollably, inconsolably. With eyes glazed over with your tears and your mother’s blood. But now, even though I see like that again, I have learned, in all my many, many years of things parting, how to cope with it. I can see clearer than ever before, and I can see things for what they really are: shapes and colors, and we all blend into each other. That’s what’s important to remember.</p>

<p>She stopped speaking and looked forward, the cigar still burning in her mouth. She crossed her legs, placing her right leg on her left knee.</p>

<p>—Tia Hesme? said Alessandro.</p>

<p>But no reply, and as he said it, the cigar fell out of her mouth and into her lap. The two boys stood and stared at the fabric burn, afraid to touch the cigar or approach the woman.</p>

<p>—Tia Hesme? Alessandro said louder. They refused to touch the woman at all, and Alessandro ran out of the room, calling for his mother. </p>

<p>Calébres stayed and looked at Gueda Hesme’s eyes. Some say she spoke to him before she died, but all Calébres told the family when they came into the room, was that she asked him to put the cigar out, and he did.</p>

<p>—Is she OK? Alessandro asked.</p>

<p>Their father stepped forward and touched her wrist, finding no pulse. Had the boys’ father not declared it, no one would have thought she was dead.  </p>
