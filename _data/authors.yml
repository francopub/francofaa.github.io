  bio: I currently work in publishing, mostly ebook development and print production. I am learning full stack web development and working on my first novel. I&#8217m interested in the space where digital and publishing meet, mostly to make my work faster and more efficient and to deliver content in new and interesting ways. This blog documents everything related to the many projects I am working on.
