Franco was instrumental in bringing a client's poetry book into two different online formats. He was adept at modifying the existing files--made for print production--into mobi and ePub files. It was not an easy task with the breaks and unconventional sentence structure throughout the manuscript! Franco was undeterred and kept at it until the product was perfect. I would highly recommend him for a job that requires dedication, attention to detail, and quality results. I look forward to working with him again.
