<h1>About</h1>
<p>I like to fix things. Sentences, pages, books. I have been working in publishing since joining *Tea*, the literary magazine at the University of Florida in 2007. Since then, I&#8217;ve made publishing my career, dabbling in editorial departments, production departments, and even a literary agency before focusing on ebooks. I currently reside in the Boston area.</p>

<p>In 2014, I started **<a href="http://strangeletjournal.com">Strangelet Press </a>** with my colleagues, fellow graduates from Emerson College in Boston. We are a new science fiction and fantasy journal both in print and ebook formats. I design the print version of the book while simultaneously setting the files up for the ebook editions. I also built and designed the <a href="http://strangeletjournal.com">website</a> for the journal. Additionally, I also curate cover art and supervise the production process. Since it is a small operation of four core people, we all tend to wear different hats as we go on.
</p>
<p>In 2013, I started my freelance work in earnest. In addition to ebook development of all kinds, I also provide book layout design, editorial services, and workflow consultation to bring it all together for your project.
</p>
<p>In addition to designing for print, I also manage web-based projects. I built this website plus the website for Strangelet Press.
</p>
<p>Aside from my day job, my freelance work, and my work at Strangelet Press, I am also designing a board game and working on my own writing.
