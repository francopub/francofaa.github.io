I had a lot of freelance work to do this particular week. It made me think about whether I should quit doing this blog, but then I realized that it's probably fine. It's more like a check-in for myself and my projects. Someone might stumble upon this, but it's not adding anything terribly interesting just yet to the different subjects I am working on.

So this entry will just be about time management and adjusting to a new work-life schedule. I have no advice about this. I only have what I have done thus far to balance. 

I have been working on a project, but I'll have to compose a separate blog post for it. It's nothing to do with what I've been posting about thus far.
