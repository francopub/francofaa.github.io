I had 30 docx files, each between 300 and 400 pages long (so between 9,000 and 12,000 pages total), with random headings thrown in and also bolded text that is supposed to be a heading but is, of course, like most things in life, completely without style. 

My boss asked me to go through and apply heading 1 and heading 2 *only* to the bolded text "headings", and otherwise remove the stylings applied. That is a simple find and replace, sure, and of course, I'd have to use my best judgment to change some to H1, others to H2. (To be clear, we were both not pleased to have to do this and agreed that we should take steps in the future to avoid inconsistent styling and semantics).

So, I could've gone in and done this manually, opened each of the 30 files and done a find and replace and apply style. OR:

Sure, it took longer to make and run the script than it would've to have done it all manually (mostly because I made little errors). And sure, it's not a script I'll use a lot. But I learned a lot!

And of course, here's the script:

{% highlight Python %}

import os, pypandoc, re

curDir = os.getcwd()

for file in os.listdir(curDir): 
	if file.endswith('.docx'):
		fileName = os.path.splitext(file)[0]
		output = pypandoc.convert_file(file, 'md', outputfile= fileName + "-FA.md")
		print file + " has been converted to markdown"
        #left myself console notes so I knew where I was; 
        #like I said, this script took a really long time to run

for mdFile in os.listdir(curDir): 
	if mdFile.endswith('.md'):
	    #now we have our markdown files,
    	#which are a little easier to parse than docx
		mdFileName = os.path.splitext(mdFile)[0]
		mdFile_opened = open(mdFile)
		mdFile_contents = mdFile_opened.read()
		mdFile_opened = open(mdFile, 'w')
		regex = "\n\*\*(.*?)\*\*\n"
		subst = r"\n# \1\n"
		mdFile_contents = re.sub(regex, subst, mdFile_contents)
        #replace bolded text on its own line
        #with h1's on their own lines
		mdFile_opened.write(mdFile_contents)
		mdFile_opened.close()
		print "Headings inside of " + mdFile + " adjusted!"
        
		revertdocx = pypandoc.convert_file(mdFile, 'docx', outputfile= mdFileName + ".docx")
		print mdFile + "converted back to DOCX"


{% endhighlight %}

Wow, this script has maybe been running for like 20 minutes at least (Update: 30 minutes?). Hope nothing is going wrong!ðŸ˜…

Maybe this did take a little longer, but it has certainly been a lot less work, and writing a Python script is a lot more interesting than opening up 30 Word documents. Which I'm going to have to do anyway. (There wasn't really any way contextually to regex in the H2's).

OK it broke on the last one! Not sure why. But all I have to do is pandoc it to docx, so not a big deal.
