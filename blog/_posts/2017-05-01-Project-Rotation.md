I have extra-curricular projects I like to work on, in additon to projects at work where I am a project manager and my freelance projects (which I am careful to make sure are never a conflict of interest, in case you were wondering). The projects can include any of the following:

- Web design and development
- Book layout and design
- Editing my novel

In addition, I like to work on other stuff, like the following (most of it is just learning new things): 

- Single source / multiple output book production
- Learning Python beyond publishing
- Learning songs on guitar

Hard to prioritize day by day, so I've decided to prioritize week to week. I will be setting aside my down time to these particular projects. And I'll be displaying the project on the landing page of the blog.
