I went to a con called Vericon at Harvard University. Patrick Rothfuss was on a panel  about worldbuilding (alongside Scott Lynch, Saladin Ahmed, and Max Gladstone) and he gave  a piece of advice which I'll summarize poorly: that just because Tolkien was a language and map nerd doesn't mean you have to invent a language and make a cool map for the world in your fantasy novel. That you should make fictional / fantasy versions of things you're interested in. If you're a bird nerd, put a bunch of different types of birds in your story and describe them in detail. If you're an economics nerd, your book might be heavy on inflation and markets. Weirdly though, I *am* a language and map nerd.

In reading contemporary fantasy and science fiction, I have found most maps disappointing. I quite like the *Gentleman Bastards* series's maps and the map in *Grace of Kings* by Ken Liu. Overall few maps quite match up to Tolkien's.
