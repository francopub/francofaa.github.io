This one was going to be about maps, but I accidentally painted a painting! Isn't that fun? So as not to keep you in suspense, here it is:

![Painting of a hill overlooking a stormy sea. In the near distance, cities with white buildings and red roofs. In the far distance, a mountainous shore with black towers. Upon the sea are red-sailed ships in a line between the two civilizations.](http://www.francoalvarado.com/blog/img/painting.JPG)

It was originally something else entirely. Unfortunately I don't have a photo of it, but it was a swamp with reeds and there was a large ship approaching. I didn't like the color scheme, but eventually it came out to a completely different environment. I might add some flowers in the foreground or something. But other than that, I'm fairly happy with how it came out. Painting isn't something I'm aspiring to be great at, but it's fun and it looks all right so I can hang it somewhere.

I woke up that morning. It was Saturday. I woke up early and was by myself for a good two hours. I sat on the patio and had breakfast. And I wanted to redo the painting. I had woken up very homesick. While I was painting, I had this image in my head of a photo. It's a photo of my grandfather and my older brother, before I was born, in Moyobamba, Peru. My brother is probably 4 or 5 in the photo, holding a plastic uzi gun. It's a photo that was part of my memories of growing up, but I didn't go to that spot or even to that town until almost 20 years later. It's an outdoor space. I guess you could call it a courtyard. Maybe it'll be the next thing I paint.

Anyway, this weekend, we started a podcast as well. Haven't done anything but record a preliminary episode, but we'd been talking about it for over a month and finally got together to do it. Even if it doesn't turn out great, it's important to try things, especially creative things. Keeps the mind sharp. Another week of me trying my hand at things I'm not really very good at.
