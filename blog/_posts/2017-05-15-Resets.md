I believe I am still adjusting to this new way of working, this new way of living. I had a very productive weekend at the very least. I turned the kitchen island 90 degrees. It separates the space in a more pleasing way. My fiance√© had realized that we had just created another galley kitchen by having the kitchen island parallel to the sink / oven / countertop. It's a strange looking layout to be honest, but I tested it out today when I cooked three different meals at the same time. I made a chicken tikka masala, eggplant pasta, and pesto. Cooked for the week so I can also get back on my workout schedule.

We have started organizing our enclosed porch as well. We purchased some herbs (lavender, mint, basil, oregano, rosemary, and something that smells like lime) and petunias. It already looks better just after decluttering the space. Reorganizing one's space is very motivating. When optimizing one's life for efficiency, it's not enough to buy items and download apps. One must also understand the logical flow of the space you inhabit, whether that's the rooms in your home, the space on your desk, the route from your work to home, and so on.

At any rate, I completed a couple of freelance projects this past week, in addition to moving a client's site to another host. Fairly successful week in spite of the lack of writing and working out.
