*Strangelet* was a bimonthly literary magazine of fantasy, science fiction, and magical realism. In addition to managing the design and production, I was also a co-founder, the [website designer][StrangeletWebsite], and art editor.

For *Strangelet*, I typeset the book in Caslon with the display text as Marta. The title page typeface is Hightower and the cover a combination of typefaces to reflect the tone of the books: strange, bizarre, eerie. We produced bimonthly issues, very short, around 50 to 70 pages each, and combined them in an omnibus at the end of the year.

For the ebook edition, I was able to pull colors from the covers as the link and highlight color. By setting up the InDesign files myself, we were able to have a streamlined and efficient production process for ebook production.
