For this edition of *Beowulf*, as translated by J. Lesslie Hall, I had to tackle a layout with three different types of marginalia: line numbers, asides, and footnotes.

![Title page](title-page)
*For the cover, I created a Viking ship on the water using typographical ornaments. These were then echoed in the title page.*

![Title page, detail](title-page-detail)

![Chapter open spread](chapter-spread)
*Chapter opener spread, showing all text elements: running text, running headers, chapter number and title, glosses, footnotes, line numbers, and folios*
