*Strangelet* was a bimonthly literary magazine of fantasy, science fiction, and magical realism. In addition to creating and co-managing the website, I was also one of its co-founders and managed the [production of the books and ebooks](../StrangeletPress). The website is [strangeletjournal.com](http://strangeletjournal.com). The content manager and I also handled the updates to the site.

The website was built in Wordpress, using a child theme based on the theme Responsive.

![Home page](../../img/strangeletwebsite/1-splash-page.jpg)
*Home page with call-to-action to view the current issue of the magazine. The image and banner would change based on the cover image for that issue.*

![Mobile version](../../img/strangeletwebsite/2-mobile.jpg)
*The site is responsive.*

The following three images show story excerpts on the website. The HTML for the excerpts is pulled directly from the ebook. I then created a separate stylesheet for the web edition of the excerpt.

![Full width screen version](../../img/strangeletwebsite/3a-article-sidebars.jpg)
*Excerpt of story on a full width screen*

![Resizing screen](../../img/strangeletwebsite/3b-article-narrow.jpg)
*Making the screen smaller allows the sidebar elements to fall away to the bottom of the browser screen*

![Distraction-free version](../../img/strangeletwebsite/3c-article-no-distraction.jpg)
*This was a test version for a distraction-free version of an excerpt. This is found at [sample.strangeletjournal.com](http://sample.strangeletjournal.com).*
