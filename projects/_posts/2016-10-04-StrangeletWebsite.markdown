*Strangelet* was a bimonthly literary magazine of fantasy, science fiction, and magical realism. In addition to creating and co-managing the website, I was also one of its co-founders and managed the [production of the books and ebooks](../StrangeletPress). The website is [strangeletjournal.com](http://strangeletjournal.com). The content manager and I also handled the updates to the site.

The website was built in Wordpress, using a child theme based on the theme Responsive.

*Home page with call to action to view the current issue of the magazine*

![Mobile version](../../img/strangeletwebsite/2-mobile.jpg)
*The site is responsive. Resizing (and viewing on a phone) will adjust the look of the site.*

The following three images show story excerpts on the website. The excerpts are pulled directly from the ebook edition of the website. The CSS for the ebook is different for the website.

*Making the screen smaller allows the sidebar elements to fall away to the bottom of the browser screen*
