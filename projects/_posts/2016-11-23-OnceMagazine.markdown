*Once* magazine was a project for my magazine design class at Emerson College's Publishing MA program. The premise was of a magazine covering various folk tale, fairy tale, and fantasy topics.

*For the back cover, I took a public domain image of a German wolf stamp and edited it in Photoshop*

*To add to the whimsical nature of the project, I decided to make the table of contents into a map. I illustrated some images and combined them in Photoshop along with the appropriate text*
