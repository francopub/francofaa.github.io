For this edition of *Beowulf*, as translated by J. Lesslie Hall, I had to tackle a layout with three different types of marginalia: line numbers, asides, and footnotes.

![Dedication](beo-ded)

![Front matter opener](beo-fm)

![Spread with all marginalia](beo-marginalia)

![Marginalia detail](beo-marginalia-dt)

![Chapter opener spread](beo-chap-open)

For the cover, I created a Viking ship on the water, all created with typographical ornaments. These were then echoed in the title page.
