*Strangelet* was a bimonthly literary magazine of fantasy, science fiction, and magical realism. In addition to managing the design and production, I was also a co-founder, the [website designer](../StrangeletWebsite), and art editor.

For *Strangelet*, I typeset the book in Caslon with the display text as Marta. The title page typeface is Hightower and the cover a combination of typefaces to reflect the tone of the books: strange, bizarre, eerie. We produced bimonthly issues, very short, around 50 to 70 pages each, and combined them in an omnibus at the end of the year.

By setting up the InDesign files myself, we were able to have a streamlined and efficient production process for ebook production.
